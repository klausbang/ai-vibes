## üé® Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Effective Prompt Structure
1. **Clear Context**: Provide relevant background information
2. **Specific Requirements**: Define exact deliverables and constraints
3. **Examples**: Include examples of desired output format
4. **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or preferences
5. **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful response

### Sample Effective Prompt
```
Context: I'm building a collaborative coding platform where developers use AI assistants.

Requirements: Create a user onboarding flow that:
- Introduces new developers to AI-assisted coding
- Provides hands-on practice with AI tools
- Includes safety and best practice guidelines
- Measures user understanding and skill progression

Format: Step-by-step guide with code examples and interactive elements

Constraints: 
- Must work with GitHub Copilot
- Should complete in under 30 minutes
- Suitable for developers with 2+ years experience

Success Criteria: New users can effectively use AI tools for basic development tasks after completing the onboarding.
